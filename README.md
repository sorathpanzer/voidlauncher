![VoidLauncher]()


# VoidLauncher | CLauncher rewritten for compose UI

Only open applications that you had in mind, Instead of opening or seeing the apps before searching

If you need to rename or hide any apps, you could show the apps and then perform those operations.

Not planning to keep this as minimal as the original ( Clauncher will be as it is, with minor updates)

## Install

#### Install from [F-Droid](...) or download the APK from the [latest release](https://github.com/mlm-games/VoidLauncher/releases/).
